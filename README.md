Project to classify Goodreads review as positive or negative

Our project aims to develop a functional program that can analyze book reviews and classify them as positive or negative. There are many reasons why sentiment analysis is importantâ€“ first, it can be used to analyze trends and opinions in a particular market or industry, allowing businesses to make more informed decisions about product development, marketing, and advertising.  By using sentiment analysis, authors can gain insights into the current literary landscape and what is popular. Moreover, language is evolving rapidly, and understanding the tone and meaning of a review can be challenging for some. A program like this can aid those who struggle with understanding tone and provide a better understanding of the review's overall sentiment
